# IIT Project - To Do List

# Project Description
The To-Do List Manager is a simple console-based application written in Python to help users manage their tasks. It allows users to organize tasks, set deadlines, and track their progress. The application provides the ability to add, view, edit, delete tasks, and mark them as completed.

The data is stored persistently across sessions using a plain text file (tasks.txt). This means that tasks will remain saved even after closing and reopening the application.

# Features Implemented
**Add Task**: Allows users to add a new task with a description and a deadline.

**View Tasks**: Displays all tasks, categorized into "Pending" and "Completed".
**Edit Task**: Users can edit a task's description, deadline, or mark it as completed.
**Delete Task**: Users can delete a task by its unique ID.
**Mark Task as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed, and the status will be updated.
**Persistent Data Storage**: Tasks are stored in a text file (tasks.txt), ensuring they persist across program sessions.
